*bnum* #h(1fr) 05/2021 -- Present \
#link("https://crates.io/crates/bnum")[Rust library] with over 150,000 downloads that provides fixed size signed and unsigned integer types, designed to extend the functionality of Rust's primitive integer types to arbitrary bit sizes. I am currently developing a floating point type that similarly will extend the functionality of Rust's floating point types to arbitrary bit sizes.
