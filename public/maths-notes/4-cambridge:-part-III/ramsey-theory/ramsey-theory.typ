== Ramsey's theorem

#notation[
    $NN$ denotes the set of positive integers, $[n] = {1, ..., n}$, and $X^((r)) = {A subset.eq X: |A| = r}$. Elements of a set are written in ascending order, e.g. ${i, j}$ means $i < j$.
]
#definition[
    A *$k$-colouring* on $A^((r))$ is a function $c: A^((r)) -> [k]$.
]
#example[
    - Colour ${i, j} in NN^((2))$ red if $i + j$ is even and blue if $i + j$ is odd. Then $M = 2 NN$ is a monochromatic subset.
    - Colour ${i, j} in NN^((2))$ red if $max{n in NN: 2^n | (i + j)}$ is even and blue otherwise. $M = {4^n: n in NN}$ is a monochromatic subset.
    - Colour ${i, j} in NN^((2))$ red if $i + j$ has an even number of distinct prime divisors and blue otherwise. No explicit monochromatic subset is known.
]
#theorem(name: "Ramsey's Theorem for Pairs")[
    Let $NN^((2))$ are $2$-coloured by $c: NN^((2)) -> {1, 2}$. Then there exists an infinite monochromatic subset $M$.
]<thm:ramseys-theorem-for-pairs>
#proof[
    - Let $a_1 in A_0 := NN$. There exists an infinite set $A_1 subset.eq A_0$ such that $c(a_1, i) = c_1$ for all $i in A_1$.
    - Let $a_2 in A_1$. There exists infinite $A_2 subset.eq A_1$ such that $c(a_2, i) = c_2)$ for all $i in A_2$.
    - Repeating this inductively gives a sequence $a_1 < a_2 < dots.c < a_k < dots.c$ and $A_1 supset.eq A_2 supset.eq dots.c$ such that $c(a_i, j) = c_i$ for all $j in A_i$.
    - One colour appears infinitely many times: $c_(i_1) = c_(i_2) = dots.c = c_(i_k) = dots.c = c$.
    - $M = \{a_(i_1), a_(i_2), ...\}$ is a monochromatic set.
]
#remark[
    - The same proof works for any $k in NN$ colours.
    - The proof is called a "2-pass proof".
    - An alternative proof for $k$ colours is split the $k$ colours $1, ..., k$ into $2$ colours: $1$ and "$2 "or" ... "or" k$", and use induction.
]
#note[
    An infinite monochromatic set is *very* different from an arbitrarily large finite monochromatic set.
]
#example[
    Let $A_1 = {1, 2}$, $A_2 = {3, 4, 5}$, etc. Let ${i, j}$ be red if $i, j in A_k$ for some $k$. There exist arbitrarily large monochromatic red sets but no infinite monochromatic red sets.
]
#example[
    Colour ${i < j < k}$ red iff $i | (j + k)$. A monochromatic subset $M = {2^n: n in NN_0}$ is a monochromatic set.
]
#theorem(name: [Ramsey's Theorem for $r$-sets])[
    Let $NN^((r))$ be finitely coloured. Then there exists a monochromatic infinite set.
]
#proof[
    - $r = 1$: use pigeonhole principle.
    - $r = 2$: Ramsey's theorem for pairs.
    - For general $r$, use induction.
    - Let $c: NN^(r) -> [k]$ be a $k$-colouring. Let $a_1 in NN$, and consider all $r - 1$ sets of $NN \\ {a_1}$, induce colouring $c': (NN \\ {a_1})^((r - 1)) -> [k]$ via $c'(F) = c(F union {a_1})$.
    - By inductive hypothesis, there exists $A_1 subset.eq NN \\ {a_1}$ such that $c'$ is constant on it (taking value $c_1$).
    - Now pick $a_2 in A_1$ and induce a colouring $c': (A_1 \\ {a_2})^((r - 1)) -> [k]$ such that $c'(F) = c(F union {a_2})$. By inductive hypothesis, there exists $A_2 subset.eq A_1 \\ {a_2}}$ such that $c'$ is constant on it (taking value $c_2$).
    - Repeating this gives $a_1, a_2, ...$ and $A_1, A_2, ...$ such that $A_(i + 1) subset.eq A_i \\ {a_(i + 1)}$ and $c(F union {a_i}) = c_i$ for all $F subset.eq A_(i + 1)$, for $|F| = r - 1$.
    - One colour must appear infinitely many times: $c_(i_1) = c_(i_2) = dots.c = c$.
    - $M = {a_(i_1), a_(i_2), ...}$ is a monochromatic set.
]

== Applications of Ramsey's theorem

#example[
    In a totally ordered set, any sequence has monotonic subsequence.
]
#proof[
    - Let $(x_n)$ be a sequence, colour ${i, j}$ red if $x_i <= x_j$ and blue otherwise.
    - By Ramsey's theorem for pairs, $M = {i_1 < i_2 < dots.c}$ is monochromatic. If $M$ is red, then the subsequence $x_(i_1), x_(i_2), ...$ is increasing, and is strictly decreasing otherwise.
    - We can insist that $\(x_(i_j)\)$ is either concave or convex: $2$-colour $NN^((3))$ by colouring ${j < k < ell}$ #clr("red") if $(i, x_(i_j)), (j, x_(i_k)), (k, x_(i_ell))$ form a convex triple, and #clr("blue") if they form a concave triple. Then by Ramsey's theorem for $r$-sets, there is an infinite convex or concave subsequence.
]
#theorem(name: "Finite Ramsey")[
    Let $r, m, k in NN$. There exists $n in NN$ such that whenever $[n]^((r))$ is $k$-coloured, we can find a monochromatic set of size (at least) $m$.
]<thm:finite-ramsey>
#proof[
    - Assume not, i.e. $forall n in NN$, there exists colouring $c_n: [n]^((r)) -> [k]$ with no monochromatic $m$-sets.
    - There are only finitely many ($k$) ways to $k$-colour $[r]^((r))$, so there are infinitely many of colourings $c_r, c_(r + 1), ...$ that agree on $[r]^((r))$: $c_i |_([r]^((r))) = d_r$ for all $i$ in some infinite set $A_1$, where $d_r$ is a $k$-colouring of $[r]^((r))$.
    - Similarly, $[r + 1]^((r))$ has only finitely many possible $k$-colourings. So there exists infinite $A_2 subset.eq A_1$ such that for all $i in A_2$, $c_i |_([r + 1]^((r))) = d_(r + 1)$, where $d_(r + 1)$ is a $k$-colouring of $[r + 1]^((r))$.
    - Continuing this process inductively, we obtain $A_1 supset.eq A_2 supset.eq dots.c supset.eq A_n$. There is no monochromatic $m$-set for any $d_n: [n]^((r)) -> [k]$ (because $d_n = c_i|_([n]^((r)))$ for some $i$).
    - These $d_n$'s are nested: $d_ell|_([n]^((r))) = d_n$ for $ell > n$.
    - Finally, we colour $NN^((r))$ by the colouring $c: NN^((r)) -> [k]$, $c(F) = d_n (F)$ where $n = max(F)$ (or in fact $n >= max(F)$, which is well-defined by above). So $c$ has no monochromatic $m$-set (since $M$ was a monochromatic $m$-set, then taking $ell = max(M)$, $d_ell$ has a monochromatic $m$-set), which contradicts Ramsey's Theorem for $r$-sets.
]
#remark[
    - This proof gives no bound on $n = n(k, m)$, there are other proofs that give a bound.
    - It is a proof by compactness (essentially, we proved that ${0, 1}^NN$ with the product topology, i.e. the topology derived from the metric $d(f, g) = 1/min{n in NN: f(n) != g(n)}$, is sequentially compact).

#remark[
    Now consider a colouring $c: NN^((2)) -> X$ with $X$ potentially infinite. Can $c$ be injective?
    - $c({i, j}) = i$ is... TODO finish
]
#theorem(name: "Canonical Ramsey")[
    Let $c: NN^((2)) -> X$ be a colouring with $X$ an arbitrary set. Then there exists an infinite set $M$ such that:
    + $c$ is constant on $M^((2))$, or
    + $c$ is injective on $M^((2))$, or
    + $c({i, j}) = c({k, l})$ iff $i = k$ for all $i < j$ and $k < l$, $i, j, k, l in M$, or
    + $c({i, j}) = c({k, l})$ iff $j = l$ for all $i < j$ and $k < l$, $i, j, k, l in M$.
]
#proof[
    - $2$-colour $NN^((4))$ by: $i j k l$ is red if $c(i j) = c(k l)$ and blue otherwise. By Ramsey's Theorem for $4$-sets, there is an infinite monochromatic set $M_1$.
    - If $M_1$ is red, then $c$ is constant on $M_1^((2))$: if pick $m < n$ with $m > l$, then $c(i j) = c(m n) = c(k l)$.
    - So assume $M_1$ is blue.
    - Colour $M_1^((4))$ by giving $i j k l$ colour green if $c(i l) = c(j k)$ and purple otherwise. By Ramsey's theorem for $4$-sets, there exists an infinite monochromatic $M_2 subset.eq M_1$ for this colouring.
    - Assume $M_2$ is coloured green: if $i < j < k < l < m < n in M_2$, then $c(j k) = c(i n) = c(l m)$ (consider $i j k n$ and $i l m n$): contradiction, since $M_1$ is blue.
    - Hence $M_2$ is purple, i.e. for $i j k l in M_2^((4))$, $c(i l) != c(j k)$.
    - Colour $M_2$ by: $i j k l$ is orange if $c(i k) = c(j l)$, and pink otherwise.
    - By Ramsey's theorem for $4$-sets, there exists infinite monochromatic $M_3 subset.eq M_2$ for this colouring.
    - Assume $M_3$ is orange, then for $i < j < k < l < m < n in M_3$, we have $c(j m) = c(l n)$ (consider $j l m n$) and $c(j m) = c(i k)$ (consider $i j k m$): contradiction, since $M_3 subset.eq M_1$.
    - Hence $M_3$ is pink, i.e. for $i j k l$, $c(i k) != c(j l)$.
    - Colour $M_3^((3))$ by: $i j k$ is yellow if $c(i j) = c(j k)$ and grey otherwise. By Ramsey's theorem for $3$-sets, there exists infinite monochromatic $M_4 subset.eq M_3$ for this colouring.
    - Assume $M_4$ is yellow: then (considering $i j k l in M_4^((4))$) $c(i j) = c(j k) = c(k l)$: contradiction, since $M_4 subset.eq M_1$.
    - So for any $i j k in M_4^((3))$, $c(i j) != c(j k)$.
    - Finally, colour $M_4^((3))$ by: $i j k$ is gold if $c(i j) = c(i k)$ and $c(i k) = c(j k)$, silver if $c(i j) = c(i k)$ and $c(i k) != c(j k)$, bronze if $c(i j) != c(i k)$ and $c(i k) = c(j k)$, and platinum if $c(i j) != c(i k)$ and $c(i k) != c(j k)$.
    - By Ramsey's theorem for $3$-sets, there exists monochromatic $M_5 subset.eq M_4$. $M_5$ cannot be gold, since then $c(i j) = c(j k)$: contradiction, since $M_5 subset.eq M_4$. If silver, then we have case 3 in the theorem. If bronze, then we have case 4 in the theorem. If platinum, then we have case 2 in the theorem.
