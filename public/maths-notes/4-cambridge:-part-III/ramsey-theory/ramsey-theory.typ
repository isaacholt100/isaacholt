= Monochromatic sets

== Ramsey's theorem

#notation[
    $NN$ denotes the set of positive integers, $[n] = {1, ..., n}$, and $X^((r)) = {A subset.eq X: |A| = r}$. Elements of a set are written in ascending order, e.g. ${i, j}$ means $i < j$.
]
#example[
    - Colour ${i, j} in NN^((2))$ red if $i + j$ is even and blue if $i + j$ is odd. Then $M = 2 NN$ is a monochromatic subset.
    - Colour ${i, j} in NN^((2))$ red if $max{n in NN: 2^n | (i + j)}$ is even and blue otherwise. $M = {4^n: n in NN}$ is a monochromatic subset.
    - Colour ${i, j} in NN^((2))$ red if $i + j$ has an even number of distinct prime divisors and blue otherwise. No explicit monochromatic subset is known.
]
#theorem(name: "Ramsey's Theorem for Pairs")[
    Let $NN^((2))$ are $2$-coloured by $c: NN^((2)) -> {1, 2}$. Then there exists an infinite monochromatic subset $M$.
]<thm:ramseys-theorem-for-pairs>
#proof[
    - Let $a_1 in A_0 := NN$. There exists an infinite set $A_1 subset.eq A_0$ such that $c(a_1, i) = c_1$ for all $i in A_1$.
    - Let $a_2 in A_1$. There exists infinite $A_2 subset.eq A_1$ such that $c(a_2, i) = c_2)$ for all $i in A_2$.
    - Repeating this inductively gives a sequence $a_1 < a_2 < dots.c < a_k < dots.c$ and $A_1 supset.eq A_2 supset.eq dots.c$ such that $c(a_i, j) = c_i$ for all $j in A_i$.
    - One colour appears infinitely many times: $c_(i_1) = c_(i_2) = dots.c = c_(i_k) = dots.c = c$.
    - $M = \{a_(i_1), a_(i_2), ...\}$ is a monochromatic set.
]
#remark[
    - The same proof works for any $k in NN$ colours.
    - The proof is called a "2-pass proof".
    - An alternative proof for $k$ colours is split colours $1, ... k$ into $1$ and $2, ..., k$ and use induction.
]
#note[
    An infinite monochromatic set is *very* different from an arbitrarily large finite monochromatic set.
]
#example[
    Let $A_1 = {1, 2}$, $A_2 = {3, 4, 5}$, etc. Let ${i, j}$ be red if $i, j in A_k$ for some $k$. There exist arbitrarily large monochromatic red sets but no infinite monochromatic red sets.
]
#example[
    Colour ${i < j < k}$ red iff $i | (j + k)$. A monochromatic subset $M = {2^n: n in NN_0}$ is a monochromatic set.
]
#theorem(name: [Ramsey's Theorem for $r$-sets])[
    Let $NN^((r))$ be finitely coloured. Then there exists a monochromatic infinite set.
]
#proof[
    - $r = 1$: use pigeonhole principle.
    - $r = 2$: Ramsey's theorem for pairs.
    - For general $r$, use induction.
    - Let $c: NN^(r) -> [k]$ be a $k$-colouring. Let $a_1 in NN$, and consider all $r - 1$ sets of $NN \\ {a_1}$, induce colouring $c': (NN \\ {a_1})^((r - 1)) -> [k]$ via $c'(F) = c(F union {a_1})$.
    - By inductive hypothesis, there exists $A_1 subset.eq NN \\ {a_1}$ such that $c'$ is constant on it (taking value $c_1$).
    - Now pick $a_2 in A_1$ and induce a colouring $c': (A_1 \\ {a_2})^((r - 1)) -> [k]$ such that $c'(F) = c(F union {a_2})$. By inductive hypothesis, there exists $A_2 subset.eq A_1 \\ {a_2}}$ such that $c'$ is constant on it (taking value $c_2$).
    - Repeating this gives $a_1, a_2, ...$ and $A_1, A_2, ...$ such that $A_(i + 1) subset.eq A_i \\ {a_(i + 1)}$ and $c(F union {a_i}) = c_i$ for all $F subset.eq A_(i + 1)$, for $|F| = r - 1$.
    - One colour must appear infinitely many times: $c_(i_1) = c_(i_2) = dots.c = c$.
    - $M = {a_(i_1), a_(i_2), ...}$ is a monochromatic set.

== Applications of Ramsey's theorem

#example[
    In a totally ordered set, any sequence has monotonic subsequence.
]
#proof[
    - Let the sequence be $x_1, x_2, ...$. Colour ${i, j}$ red if $x_i <= x_j$ and blue otherwise.
    - By Ramsey's theorem for pairs, $M = {i_1 < i_2 < dots.c}$ is monochromatic. If $M$ is red, then the subsequence $x_(i_1), x_(i_2), ...$ is increasing, and is strictly decreasing otherwise.
    - We can insist that $(x_(i_j))$ is either concave or convex. For a triple $(i_(j_1), i_(j_2), i_(j_3))$, it is convex... TODO finish.
]
#theorem(name: "Finite Ramsey's Theorem")[
    Let $r, m, k in NN$. There exists $n in NN$ such that whenever $[n]^((r))$ is $k$-coloured, we can find a monochromatic set of size at least $m$.
]<thm:finite-ramsey>
#proof[
    - Assume not, i.e. $forall n in NN$, there exists colouring $c_n: [n]^((r)) -> [k]$ with no monochromatic $m$-sets.
    - There are only finitely many ways to $k$-colour $[r]^((r))$, so there are infinitely many $c_n$ that agree on $[r]^((r))$ for some $n in A_1$: $c_n |_([r]^((r))) = $. TODO.
    - $[r + 1]^((r))$ has only finitely many possible $k$-colourings.
    - So there exists $A_2 subset.eq A_1$ such that $c_n |_([r + 1]^((r))) = d_(r + 1)$.
    - Continuing this process, we obtain $A_1 supset.eq A_2 supset.eq dots.c supset.eq A_n$. There is no monochromatic $m$-set for any $d_n: [n]^((r)) -> [k]$ (because $d_n = c_i|_([n]^((r)))$).
    - These $d_n$'s are nested: $d_j|_([i]^((r))) = d_i$ for $j > i$.
    - Finally, we colour $NN^((r))$ be $c(F) = d_n (F)$ where $n = max(F)$ (or in fact $n >= max(F)$, which is well-defined by above). This contradicts Ramsey's Theorem for $r$-sets.
