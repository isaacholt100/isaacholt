== Basic properties of fields

- *Definition*: ring $R$ is *field* if every element of $R - {0}$ has mutliplicative inverse and $1 != 0 in R$.
- *Lemma*: every field is integral domain.
- *Definition*: field homomorphism is a ring homomorphism $phi: K -> L$ between fields:
    - $phi(a + b) = phi(a) + phi(b)$
    - $phi(a b) = phi(a) phi(b)$
    - $phi(1) = 1$
These imply $phi(0) = 0$, $phi(-a) = -phi(a)$, $phi(a^(-1)) = phi(a)^(-1)$.
- *Lemma*: let $phi: K -> L$ homomorphism.
    - $im(phi) = {phi(a): a in K}$ is a field.
    - $ker(phi) = {a in K: phi(a) = 0} = {0}$, i.e. $phi$ is injective.
- *Definition*: *subfield* $K$ of field $L$ is subring of $L$ where $K$ is a field. $L$ is a *field extension* of $K$.
- The above lemma shows the image of $phi: K -> L$ is a subfield of $L$.
- *Lemma*: intersections of subfields are subfields.
- *Prime subfield* of $L$: intersection of all subfields of field $L$.
- *Definition*: *characteristic* $char(K)$ of field $K$ is $ char(K) := min({0} union {n in NN: chi(n) = 0}) $ where $chi: ZZ -> K$, $chi(m) = 1 + dots.h.c + 1$ ($m$ times).
- *Example*: $char(QQ) = char(RR) = char(CC) = 0$, $char(FF_p) = p$ for $p$ prime.
- *Lemma*: for any field $K$, $char(K)$ is either $0$ or a prime.
- *Theorem*:
    - $char(K) = 0$ iff $QQ$ is the prime subfield of $K$.
    - $char(K) = p > 0$ iff $FF_p$ is the prime subfield of $K$.
- Note $p | binom(p, i)$ so $(a + b)^p = a^p + b^p$.
