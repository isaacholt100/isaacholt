- No need to memorise chapters 1-2
- Know definition of wave function, relation to probability
- Expectation values, uncertainty
- Standard Gaussian integral formula
- Infinite potential well and know the eigenfunctions for this potential (sines and cosines)
- Momentum operator
- Canonical expectation relation: [x, p] = i hbar
- Schrodinger's equation
- Wave function continuous and differentiable except where V undefined

- Matrix elements of operators
- Discrete and continuous spectra of eigenvalues
- **Formula for Dirac delta in terms of integral of complex exponential**
- **Subsequent measurements of quantities which are/aren't compatible**
- Evolution of wave function with time and superposition of solutions to Schrodinger's equation
- Don't need to know formula for propagator
